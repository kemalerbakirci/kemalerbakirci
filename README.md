## **About Me**

I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science & Engineering.  
My core interests lie in the intersection of **IoT**, **autonomy**, and **systems programming**. I’m particularly focused on:

- Developing **sensor-driven systems** that simulate or implement autonomous logic  
- Exploring **real-time data communication protocols** (MQTT, WebSocket, CoAP)  
- Designing **rule-based engines** for automation and alerting  
- Architecting scalable applications using **FastAPI**, **PostgreSQL**, **Docker**, and **React**

I aim to specialize in **autonomous IoT platforms** and **distributed system design**, and I'm constantly improving my skills in these areas by building practical, well-documented projects.

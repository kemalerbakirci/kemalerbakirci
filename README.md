## 👋 Hi there!

I'm Kemal — a final-year CSE student who enjoys building intelligent, connected systems that interact with the physical world.

My key areas of interest include:

- 🌐 **IoT architectures** and sensor-based communication
- 🤖 **Autonomous systems** and edge intelligence
- ⚙️ **Backend platforms** using FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and MQTT
- 🖥️ **Frontend dashboards** with React and WebSocket streaming

Every project I share on GitHub is carefully documented and structured so others can learn from real-world-inspired simulations and implementations.

## 🧠 What I'm Currently Doing

I'm consistently building open-source repositories that reflect my learning and focus areas.  
My projects span beginner to advanced level and aim to provide hands-on exposure to:

- **Rule-based logic**
- **Sensor simulation**
- **Protocol benchmarking**
- **Data streaming and visualization**
- **Containerized full-stack platforms**

Some of the key repositories I’ve developed:

- **[IoT Monitoring Platform](https://github.com/kemalerbakirci/IoT-Monitoring-Platform)**  
  *Real-time full-stack platform for telemetry, MQTT messaging, and dashboard visualizations.*

- **[Elderly Care Home Alert Engine](https://github.com/kemalerbakirci/Elderly-Care-Home-Alert-Engine)**  
  *Rule-based engine for detecting inactivity, fall risks, and bathroom usage patterns.*

- **[MQTT Fundamentals](https://github.com/kemalerbakirci/MQTT-Fundamentals)**  
  *Lightweight CLI-based pub/sub simulation with detailed MQTT topic handling.*

- **[MQTT vs HTTP Performance](https://github.com/kemalerbakirci/MQTT-vs-HTTP-Performance)**  
  *Benchmark tool comparing latency between MQTT and HTTP protocols.*

- **[Multi-Sensor Smart Home Simulation](https://github.com/kemalerbakirci/Multi-Sensor-Smart-Home-Simulation)**  
  *Simulates temperature, humidity, and motion sensors publishing to MQTT topics.*

- **[Benchmarking IoT Rules Engine](https://github.com/kemalerbakirci/Benchmarking-IoT-Rules-Engine-with-Different-Rule-Storage-Backends)**  
  *Evaluates different rule storage backends like TinyDB, JSON, and SQLite.*

## 🛠️ Tools & Focus Areas

I'm actively building deeper expertise in:

- MQTT, Node-RED, WebSockets
- FastAPI, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy
- React, Vite, NGINX
- Docker, Docker Compose
- Data logging, sensor emulation
- Backend ↔ Frontend ↔ Broker architecture
